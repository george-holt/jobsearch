Throughout the last year many have checked to see if I was “okay”, as Amazon has encouraged employees to “return to office”.  Previously, I said; “Yes. I’m okay for now. We’ll see what happens.” Until now.

I love the people I work with and I love working on software and developer tools. But next year Amazon will require that I relocate from Houston to Seattle.

In 2022 I relocated my family (with 2 school-age kids) to Houston -  and we are still just settling in. That was hard. Finding another new home (in this market!), packing up, changing schools, and starting over again in Seattle would be a very hard choice to make.

For the last 5 years I’ve been working on developer experiences at AWS, with the last two focusing on generative AI. As a manager of managers I’ve had the opportunity to build and mentor a very strong team. The team adapted quickly and performed well as a remote team through the pandemic. 

I’m excited to bring this history of success to a company that welcomes remote workers. Please follow up directly with me on LinkedIn.
